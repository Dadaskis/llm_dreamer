# llm_dreamer.py - AI-Powered Script Generation and Execution

This script uses AI (via OpenRouter API) to generate and execute Python scripts based on creative ideas. It's like having an endless stream of programmer humor generated by AI!
*It is horrible as it sounds, trust me.*

## How it works

1. **Fetches 20 funny Python script ideas** from an AI model
2. **Iterates through each idea**, generating a complete Python script implementation
3. **Saves each script** with an AI-generated filename
4. **Executes the script** automatically

## Features

- Uses OpenRouter API to access various AI models
- Generates creative, humorous Python script ideas
- Creates complete, working Python code based on those ideas
- Automatically names each generated script
- Runs each script immediately after creation
- Saves all generated scripts to a `generated_scripts/` directory

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `openai` Python package (`pip install openai`)
- OpenRouter API token

## Setup

1. Create a `token.txt` file in the same directory as the script
2. Add your OpenRouter API token to this file
3. Run the script: `python llm_dreamer.py`

## Example Output

The script will generate scripts with creative names like:
- `mr_robot_script.py`
- `talking_cat_clock.py`
- `console_prankster.py`

## Warning

This script automatically executes AI-generated code. Use with caution and in isolated environments only. The AI might generate code that could be harmful or behave unexpectedly.
